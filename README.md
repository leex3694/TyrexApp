# TyrexApp
An app I made for a marketing team at Medtronic which shows a hospital the economic value of purchasing Tyrex to reduce
the risk of infection.

I made it full stack in order to practice and show my ability to do it, though in theory this didn't need to be full stack.
All the information in the app is from public studies, so there is nothing proprietary here therefore, all prices and info can be stored right in the javascript as variables and no need to send anything to servers. But again, I did it for demonstration and practice purposes.
